Project in C Programming

Each driver is given an initial number of ten (10) points. For every single offense (illegal parking, speeding, etc.) corresponds one (1) grade, while any serious offense (dangerous driving, driving under the feeling of drunkenness, etc.) is punished by removing five (5) points. If the number of points a driver becomes zero (0) or negative, the driving license is removed.As part of the exercise, it is considered that the owner of a vehicle is also his only driver. The list of penalties is provided as a file (text file) containing the number movement of the vehicle and the type of penalty (simple / serious). The file name is offenses.txt. The driver list is comprised of its Identity Card Number (ID) the driver and the number of the folowing guide are available in another text file called drivers.txt. A third text file, called owner.txt, corresponds the registration number of a vehicle in its owner's ID. We consider his number driving license is only unique with 9 seats even the number of traffic a vehicle consists of three (3) capital Latin characters followed by four (4) digits and are also unique for each vehicle.
